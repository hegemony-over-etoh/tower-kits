	Pushing platform trampolines are like x pushers, but after reaching their end goal will "rebound" the player upwards like a trampoline.
	Most attributes you would want to change are direct properties of the forces themselves, 
	with the only relevant attribute being "ReboundForceMultipler" which determines how strong the counter force is. Higher multiplier = higher bounce.
