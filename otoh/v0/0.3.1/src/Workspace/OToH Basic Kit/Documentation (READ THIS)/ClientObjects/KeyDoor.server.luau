--[==[
	Keys Doors are parts that can only be opened/unlocked by using a key with a matching `KeyId`.
	
	Since keys are pretty rigid due to technical reasons, the only current attribute is the `KeyId` required to open the door.
	
	**This is a touch activated object. Please read the "Touch Activated Objects" documentation in General Info for additional attributes.**
