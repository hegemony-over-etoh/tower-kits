## Why

I once proposed the EToH v6 kit to be published directly on GitHub in the V6
documentation group, which a developer said they would make a script to do so.
Seemingly they forgot to, and I want to easy-reference the kits when
implementing my own kits.

This has nothing to do with my ban from the EToH server.

I did include earlier V6 kits that I had prior to release. These are just
outdated tech, there isn't anything special other than showing how the V6 kit
evolved. Now that the V6 kit has been published for a while, 

I have no means of direct contact to EToH following my ban, except the one
contact I have that has ghosted me since the ban. So I'm going to assume
it is safe to publish the outdated versions.

If the EToH developer team wants these removed, feel free to send a PR, or file
an issue, or just DM me @ znotfireman, or hose a public guillotine ceremony IDK.

This is mostly a sideshow for more projects by Hegemony Over EToH :)

## Versioning

Everything in `etoh/v6` follows SemVer versioning. Other kits doesn't have clear
versioning :(, so I tried to follow SemVer.
